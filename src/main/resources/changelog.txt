CHANGELOG:

--------// Explorercraft 1.15.2 // ----------------------------------------------------
Patch 4.0.0:

+ Wooden Trapdoors + Doors are now flammable!
@todo Change Tree() code to tree generation code when updated



--------// Explorercraft 1.14.4 // ----------------------------------------------------
Patch 3.2.2:
+ added Custom Villager Trades (might be conflict with other mods)
+ tweaked world generation of the Slate Dungeon code (possible fix to an issue someone was having)
+ Fixed Polished Basalt, Marble and Slate all dropping bricks and not polished variants - no idea how that slipped through and for how long!
+ Tweaked and changed functionality of the Wizard Trading - the initial wizard I spawned in the structure, all his trades were duplicated, so now the wizard has poor memory and randomly changes his mind on what he's selling! :P
+ added Jade Longbow added
+ added Enderghast to the End

Patch 3.2.3:
- Removed a config conflict where disabling the enderreeper disabled both the enderghast + enderreeper and the enderghast config did nothing
+ Added new rare spawns to the enderreeper spawning in the overworld and nether biome, similar to the enderman (these are configurable)
+ Special thanks to MasterSloth1 for providing me with OreDict variants of my tools/armors recipes which allow for other mod gems to be used to make explorercraft tools!
+ Added Russian translation

Patch 3.2.4:
+ Changed Gem Blocks languages file to match vanilla: Block of Gem
+ Added wizard/wizard tower weights, to increase the chance of them spawning
+ Tweaked some loot-tables to reduce conflicts

+ Updated to latest and recommended forge
+ Updated Noctiluca Artwork

+ Renamed "Bamboo Forest" to "Bamboo Grove"
+ Renamed "Bamboo" to "Thick Bamboo" in order to reduce conflicts with Vanilla bamboo

Patch 3.2.7:
